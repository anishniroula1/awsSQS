Document Ingestion Rules
Global Asylee Documents
Global asylee documents come from two different sources:

Asylee
Asylee Lockbox
Asylee Rule
For the Asylee category, the key documents we focus on are Written Statements. The ingestion process includes the following steps:

During ingestion, any documents that are not Written Statements - English are ignored.
If there are multiple Written Statements - English, we take the latest one based on the last modified date.
Asylee Lockbox Rule
For the Asylee Lockbox category, we receive multiple document types:

generalSupport
unmatchedDocuments
i589
Written Statements
Part B
The process for handling these documents is as follows:

Part B information is extracted from a JSON object via an API (example.com).
Written Statements - English and Supplement are identified from the other documents listed above.
Each document is fetched from the S3 bucket, and the metadata is checked for Written Statements or I-589.
If a document contains a Written Statement, it is saved.
If a document contains I-589, the supplement is extracted and saved in our database.
CMS Asylee Documents
For CMS Asylee documents, the key documents we focus on are:

I-589
Written Statements or Written Statements - English
The process includes:

If there are multiple Written Statements or Written Statements - English, we prioritize the latest Written Statements - English based on the created date.
Written Statements - English are always prioritized over Written Statements.
We also process I-589 JSON documents. If there are no I-589 JSON documents, we do not proceed with that case.
