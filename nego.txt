Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunities and experiences I’ve had over the past two years as a Data Engineer at BridgePhase/InADev. During this time, I have gained extensive knowledge and contributed significantly to the success of multiple projects.

I’ve been privileged to lead and manage various initiatives, including E-Processing, Doc Ingest 2.0 migration, Admin, Gina, APSO, and more. In addition to leading these projects, I’ve taken an active role in troubleshooting and resolving critical issues, ensuring the team operates efficiently and delivers high-quality results.

While I initially joined as a Developer, my responsibilities have grown significantly to encompass leadership roles and managing multiple high-impact projects. This has required me to put in substantial extra hours and go above and beyond my original scope of work.

Recently, I’ve had discussions with other companies in the industry, and I’ve received offers in the range of $210k annually. While I truly value my role at BridgePhase/InADev and the collaborative environment we’ve fostered, I feel that my current compensation does not reflect the leadership responsibilities and the value I bring to the team.

I would like to discuss aligning my compensation with the market rate for my expanded role and responsibilities. My goal is to continue contributing to the company’s success while feeling that my efforts are recognized and valued fairly.

I appreciate your understanding and would be happy to discuss this further at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
